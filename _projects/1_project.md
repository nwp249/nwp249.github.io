This is the beginning of documention for my team's collaborative project for AI/Machine Learning club, 
a smart mirror running on a custom Android app frontend designed in Android Studio and incorporating 
a trained model of Google's Gemini generative AI.

Essentially, the project is a screen laid behind a two-way mirror that can be interacted with through voice commands. It will have a variety of functions, but it is mainly focused on the 
Gemini AI integration in order to complete tasks such as retrieving weather conditions. Throughout the first few steps of this project, I have been introduced to a variety of new tools. Most 
significantly, I began using Android Studio to design an Android app and Google Colab to practice interacting with Gemini. The next step is to finalize an app design and integrate the two interfaces.
